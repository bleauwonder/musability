### Imagine knowing before you get to a music venue what the entrance is like, if there's elevators or ramps, if there's a key to the accessible bathroom, and if you can actually see the band! Well, now there's a community that can help you with that.

### musability was built out of wanting everyone to feel like a regular person just seeing a show. Some of us might have to prepare a bit for that, depending on what happens when we get to our destination. And if that venue isn't on the app, there's a place to leave a review or add a new review to a place already listed. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### This was an interesting test in patience, not only to learn the intricacies of React Native but also using Expo and it's preferences. Error after error, we kept going and learning how to see an issue even before it happens. Connecting all of this to a Firebase backend seemed so daunting at first, but once we understood the syntax and where it all belongs, it's not a bad feature to have integrated.

## See it in Action:

### The technologies used in this app:
#### * React Native
#### * Expo CLI
#### * Javascript/ES6/JSX
#### * CSS
#### * Firebase as a database
#### * JSON

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Future iterations that will be added before production will be fully adding a user account where they can add a review with photos that will update in the database as well as the app. There will be a Google Maps API added to see the nearest bus routes to the venue, as well as stronger ability to search by datatype such as accessible restroom or elevators. Flexibility will be added to allow for multiple cities and to search by type of venue.

#### There are 4 contributors to this app which will be deployed to Android and iPhone later this year.
